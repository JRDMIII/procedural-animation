# Dev Log: Procedural Animation

## The Theory
After looking it at too much rainworld content I have become very obsessed with the idea of procedural animation and specifically locomotion that isn't predefined with sprites. Hence, I will be exploring the ideas of procedural animation, hopefully making some cool things along the way!

I want to start with making a snake/worm like creature using the basic ideas of procedural animation and chained contraints. From there I want to try and make legs which move realistically and then finally make an ant which can move aroundthe environment, turning and walking and living life.
